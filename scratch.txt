Hey Wings, before we dive in to recoding the UI.  I would want to lock in the columns 1-4 setup.  I am pasting the content of the columns (1-4) as well as the comments on them.  Rows are separated by <==> for your review.  Can you confirm with 1000% certainty that we are aligned with our understanding vis-a-vis the last pdf I sent.  Here are the expected contents of cols 1-4 with comments:

Befor that Wings, I think we need to re-align our tables too as your description of some tables is not what I have and not what I seeded.  Can I send you my an sql file and have it re-interprted so we can proceed.

Hey Wings, I have put in comments when necessary to confirm your understanding::
Confirm: When a line has values in multiple PDF columns (e.g. subtotals appearing in col3 and col4), we treat:

➡️ The stored numeric value is ALWAYS column 4
⚠️ This is not always the case.  Consider this snippet of the table:
     CASH IN BANK LBP C/A	<==>		<==>	1244183	<==>		<==>	editable
                  LBP SAVINGS	<==>		<==>	125075	<==>		<==>	editable
                  DBP SAVINGS	<==>		<==>	7566	<==>		<==>	editable
                  ONE COOP (former CCB)	<==>		<==>	412980	<==>	1789804	<==>	editable / derived(sub-total)
     TOTAL (CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS)	<==>		<==>		<==>	2015586	<==>	derived

the last two line-items with values in columns 4 (all derived) are not stored yeah?

➡️ Columns 2–3 are calculated/derived as necessary
Wings, there is only one confirmed case of a column 2 value that is derived.  all the rest are editable.  here is the exemption:

NON-CURRENT ASSETS	<==>		<==>		<==>		<==>	Title ONLY
    PROPERTY & EQUIPMENT	<==>	2379333	<==>		<==>		<==>	editable
    ADD: ACQUISITION, 2023	<==>		<==>		<==>		<==>	editable
      TOTAL PPE AND ACQUISITION	<==>	2379333	<==>		<==>		<==>	derived
    LESS: ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION	<==>	1166517	<==>		<==>		<==>	editable


➡️ pdf_column defines ONLY the intended “main” value location
I do not understand this.

This matches your mapping and your intention:

Editable real values → stored in DB → placed in their intended column
could be (col 2,3 or 4)

Derived subtotals → appear where formulas say (column 3 or 4, or per one exemption above column 2)

Your earlier <==> mapping already follows this.
I hope we are on the same page on this.


If we go for option A.  Can these line-items be religiously represented? Please tell me your understanding of these line-items Wings.  And how they map if we are doing option A.

Before that just a clarification:
A snippet from your financial value seeder you created financialvalue like so:

foreach ($values as [$code, $amount]) {
            FinancialValue::create([
                'line_item_code' => $code,
                'year' => $year,
                'month' => $month,
                'amount' => $amount,
            ]);

However on the migration for financial value you have this schema:
Schema::create('financial_values', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();

            $table->foreignId('financial_line_item_id')
                ->constrained('financial_line_items')
                ->onDelete('cascade');

            $table->integer('year');     
            $table->integer('month');    

            $table->decimal('value', 15, 2)
                ->default(0);

            $table->timestamps();
        });
